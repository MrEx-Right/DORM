## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security vulnerability within DORM (e.g., RCE, Leak, Unsafe Handling), please follow these steps to report it responsibly:

### How to Report
1.  Email the details to: **[aratmakefehangmail.com]** 
2.  Include a proof-of-concept (PoC) or detailed steps to reproduce the issue.
3.  We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**.

### Our Promise
- We will investigate the issue and verify the vulnerability.
- We will release a patch as soon as possible.
- We will publicly acknowledge your contribution (with your permission) in the release notes once the issue is fixed.

### ⚠️ A Note on Usage
DORM is an offensive security tool. By design, it performs actions that might be flagged by antivirus software or IDSs. **This is expected behavior.** Please do not report "AV detection" as a security vulnerability unless it involves a supply chain attack or backdoors.

Thank you for helping keep DORM secure! 🕵️‍♂️
